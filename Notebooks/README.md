# Teleoperation Notebook

This version of the teleoperation notebook was uploaded to address a specific issue: inconsistent reversing behavior observed in earlier versions.

Through testing, we found that reverse throttle required a higher initial value to consistently engage movement, especially from a standstill. This version incorporates that behavior and improves the reliability of reverse control.

**Key Notes**
- Reverse throttle has been tuned to ensure consistent movement.
- This version may exhibit more input lag compared to the original teleoperation notebook.
- Intended for scenarios where precision in reverse is more critical than low-latency response
