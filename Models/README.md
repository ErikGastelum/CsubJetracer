This directory contains example models that were created during development.

These models are provided as a reference to demonstrate the expected capabilities of the robot after successful training. They are intended for testing and comparison purposes only.

Note: These models are not production-ready. For optimal performance, you should train your own models using data collected from your specific environment and hardware setup.
Purpose

    Verify that the inference pipeline is functioning correctly.

    Use as a baseline for evaluating newly trained models.

    Understand expected input/output behavior for road following and collision avoidance tasks.

Training Your Own Models

To achieve accurate and reliable behavior, train your own models using the provided data collection tools and training scripts tailored to your use case.
